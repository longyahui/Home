# BIOGRAPHY
Dr. Yahui Long is a postdoctoral research fellow at A * STAR, Singapore. He received his Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Hunan University in 2021. Since September 2019 till March 2021, he has been visiting Nanyang Technological University and A*STAR, Singapore. During Ph.D., he was awarded with National (Chinese) Scholarship in 2020. 

# RESEARCH FOCUS
Advanced deep learning technologies enable for characterizing tissue complexity and gaining biological insights into the spatial organization within tissues.  My research is focused on developing deep learning models to model single-cell genomic and spatial transcriptomics data. By systematically integrating multi-view or multi-omics data, I aim to provide user-friendly and computationally efficient tool for both research and clinical applications. Specifically, my research interests mainly include:

**1.Deep Learning**
- Graph Neural Network for large-scale graph mining
- Self-supervised learning
- Transfer Learning

**2.Single-cell Omics and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis**
- Spatial clustering
- Cell type deconvolution
- Spatial batch integration
- Spatial/single-cell multi-omics integration
- Cell-to-cell communication
