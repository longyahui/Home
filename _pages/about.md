I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at A * STAR, Singapore. I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Hunan University, supervised by Prof. Luo Jiawei. Since September 2019 till March 2021, I have been visiting Nanyang Technological University and A*STAR, Singapore, under the supervison of Prof. [Kwoh Chee-Keong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asckkwoh/), Prof. [Li Xiaoli](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/) and Dr. [Wu Min](https://sites.google.com/site/wumincf/). My thesis is graph-based machine learning algorithms for microbe network prediction. I received my M.S. degree from Hunan University in 2017.
